# Stocks Sentiment Analysis Using AI

We live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with social media feeds, tweets, and news articles. This huge data could be leveraged to predict people sentiment towards a particular company or stock. Natural language processing (NLP) works by converting words (text) into numbers. These numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions. AI/ML-based sentiment analysis models, can be used to understand the sentiment from public tweets, which could be used as a factor while making a buy/sell decision of securities.
